Mateusz Haligowski
==================

I'm a software engineer living in [Seattle, Washington]. I tinker a lot with many different technologies to broad my horizons and become a better programmer.

I [tweet](https://www.twitter.com/{{ site.twitter }}) from time to time, and as you probably notice I try doing some [blogging](/posts.html). Feel free to contact me via Twitter.

If you're interested in my resume, you can have it from here [PDF]({{site.resume_url}}). If you want to subscribe to my blog, the RSS channel is [here](/feed.xml).
